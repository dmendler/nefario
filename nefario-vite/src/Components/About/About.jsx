      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The Swim App was created by Danny Mendler and Brandon Hulse, two Computer Science majors at the University of Notre Dame. Both are also pursuing minors in Engineering Corporate Practice, blending their technical skills with a strong understanding of business and leadership.</p>
      <p>Danny is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Brandon is from New Jersey. Together, they combined their passion for technology and sports to build a platform that makes it easier to track, compare, and celebrate swimmer performances.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to create tools that are not only functional but also easy and enjoyable to use. We hope The Swim App helps swimmers, coaches, and fans connect with the sport in a whole new way!</p>
